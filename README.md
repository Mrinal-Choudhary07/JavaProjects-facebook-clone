## Summary of the project:
In this project we are trying to create a social networking website. We have decidede to call our website 'Pengyou'. Our application would have different users and they can use this site by signing up for it. We would also create an admin account who can view all the users, block users, view different users etc.We are also planning to provide the search functionality to users who are connected with each other.We call as connections instead of friend.If both users are connected with each other.The website would have love and like feature if the person want to post or share their photoes.The website would be having the security setting where the person can restrict some non-sharable items.

## List of technologies to be used and reason for your selection

  * All team members are mostly familiar with java.
  * Object Oriented Language.
  * Easy to implement.
  * Number one choice for the full stack developers.
  * Platform independent.
  * It is multithreaded, distributed, secure & robust.
2. Reason for choosing Spring:
  * Easily available resources and an active community around the Framework.
  * Extensibility, the fact that Spring or another framework can be built on top and extend to other mini-frameworks.

4. JSP(Java Server Pages) Reason:
  * JSP supports both scripting and element-based dynamic content, and allows programmers to develop custom tag libraries to satisfy application-specific needs.
  * JSP pages are precompiled for efficient server processing.
  * JSP pages can be used in combination with servlets that handle the business logic, the model supported by Java servlet template engines.
5. Jquery Reason:
  * All functions are guaranteed to work in all supported (by jQuery) browsers.
  * It adds lots of useful lightweight utilities on top of javascript library.
  * It allows us to break the Dependency Chain.
6. Reason for choosing mySQL:
